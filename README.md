# ResNet50 - UNet 

In this code, we are going to implement the most widely used image segmentation architecture called UNET. We are going to replace the UNET encoder with the ResNet50 implementation from the TensorFlow library. The UNET encoder would learn the features from scratch, while the ResNet50 is already trained on the Image ImageNet classification dataset. Therefore ResNet50 has already learned enough features, which improves the overall performance of the network.
